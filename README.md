# sprite-maker
sprite image creation tool

usage: 
all frames should be named with same name and differ in numeration which always goes at the end.
example: name_1, name_2, ...
Also, there must be equal amount of digits in each filename's ending.

When calling program all frames must have equal size.
Call should be made like in this example:
maker arg1 arg2 arg3
where arg1 is common name (in the example above it is: 'name_'),
arg2 is  number of digits and arg2 is number of total frames needed to be combined into one sprite.

This is not convenient of course in the future step by step we can make it more convenient.
